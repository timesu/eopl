;;1.3 Scoping and Binding of Variables

Two ways: 1.as references   (f x y)
          2.as declarations (lambda (x)..)

statically scoped:it can be determined by analyzing the text of a program alone,
                  without knowing the actual values to which the variable is
                  bound.
Dynamic:the decalration to which a variable reference refers cannot be 
        determined until the program is excuted.
